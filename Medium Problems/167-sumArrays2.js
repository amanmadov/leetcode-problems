LeetCode 167. Two Sum II â€“ Input array is sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
    Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2]

Example 2:
    Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,3]
    Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3]

Example 3:
    Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2]

Constraints:
    2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
    -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
    numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    -1000 <= target <= 1000
    The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
